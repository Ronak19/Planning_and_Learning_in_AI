Steps:
1. Run the python code 'fastslam.py'. Make sure pygame package is installed.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, right and left) to navigate the robot for localization and mapping predications for 50 steps for each value of number of particles (5, 10, 20, 100, 200).
3. Once the values for localization error and mapping error are calculated the code generates plots for localization error, mapping error over 50 steps and average localization and mapping errors over all the values of nummber of particles.
